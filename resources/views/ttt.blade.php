Research Problem and Analysis
It is common for residents in numerous countries all over the world to choose renting an apartment over owning a house. 
According to the various papers analyzed during the research, this could be due to a number of factors.
Richard K. Green (2011) shows in his research that people in the United States were forced to renting an apartment after the foreclosure of their homes. 
Another factor could be that most people are mobile, their jobs, education or lifestyle make them travel a lot, so apartment rental would be an important option for them.
A survey was conducted on campus in which questionnaires were shared to students, most especially international students.
The results from the survey show that foreign students prefer to rent an apartment for their entire stay than to buy a house. 
It also showed that more than 50% of the foreign students had difficulties getting accommodation on their arrival to the country for the first time.
Could this be because there is a shortage of houses for the incoming students? Could this be some form of racism? Or something else?
Hilber, C. A. L., and Schöni, O. (2016) document that housing in the UK (especially London and South England) is one of the most expensive and cramped in the world.
So it could be because of the cost. With all these factors getting an apartment as a foreign student may be somewhat difficult.
The aim of this research is to come up with a solution that will simplify the process.
Further research revealed that there are different kinds of apartment options for students.
The demand for each of these options were based on socioeconomic and demographic factors.
Soaita, A. M., Munro, M., and McKee, K. (2020) enumerate the different options and the kind of people that prefer each option.

Campus accommodations
This option is usually provided and maintained by the school authorities. 
It is also one of the most convenient options for students.
Main advantages; they are usually situated on the school premises, which means less stress getting to class.
They also get to live amongst colleagues in a co-ed environment. 
They can be quite expensive.

Marginal Housing
Goodman et al. (2013) defined marginal housing as boarding (renting a room in a boarding/rooming house or in a motel) on a semi-permanent basis. 
This option offers the least comfort out of all the options but the cost of rent is the lowest.
Usually have 8 to 10 people sharing the same amenities. Amenities may be in not so good conditions.
Only 2 out of 13 students chose this option during the survey on campus.

Shared Housing
This option refers to apartments that house between 2 to 5 people who share the kitchen, living room and bathroom/toilet but each have their own bedroom. 
Heath (2004) suggests that young affluent professionals who want to mingle with like-minded people usually go for this option. 
Hulse et al. (2019) posits that the demand for this housing option is on the rise due to flexibility required by labor markets today.
A very good housing option for international students, as they usually would want to live together.

Full apartment
7 out of 13 international students picked this option during our survey on campus. 
Renting a full apartment has its advantages and disadvantages.
Full privacy and not sharing amenities with outsiders being the highest advantage. 
High cost of rent seemed to be the key disadvantage.
Also it may be located far from campus, which means more stress getting to class.

Apart from the papers reviewed, similar websites or mobile apps in the apartment rental market in UK were also analyzed.
They were evaluated in terms of what they have done and also what they haven't done.

RESEARCH QUESTIONS
1.	Is there a system in place that provides accommodation options for international students?
2.	Does the system cater exclusively for international students looking for accommodation in UK?
3.	Does the system require minimal user data to operate it?

Technical Challenges
At this point, we have a clear picture of the questions posed by the project topic that need to be answered by the research. 
The next step in the research is to determine how to design and implement a system that will satisfy the objectives of the project.
The system will be in the form of a website. Why a website?
A website is a software artifact; a piece of internet 'real estate' which showcases your product, service or information to the world. 
In order to develop one, we need to have a good understanding of the traditional software development methodologies.
A software methodology can be described as a process or series of processes used in the development of software. 
It is designed in phases and describes how the life cycle of a piece of software.
Some well-known methodologies are enumerated below.

Waterfall
Using this methodology means the tasks are carried out in a sequential and non-iterative manner.
 Advantages
•	Outcomes are very clear and are declared from the onset.
•	It follows a straight sequential flow.
•	Steps are easily understoood because they are well-defined.

 Disadvantages
•	It has a rigid structure.
•	People find it difficult to establish all the outcomes from the onset.
•	If an error is made in the first step, it flows down to the other steps.


Agile: Using this methodology implies that the process and even the product or service are subject to change as a result of feedback.
  Advantages
•	It allows people to be aware of every process that is running from the onset and all the time.
•	It allows for early deliverables so as to test for feedback.
•	It allows for changes in any step of any process and at any time.

  Disadvantages
•	Constant user involvement may lead to new requirements added continuously.
•	The continuous nature of development may feel like progress is not being made.
•	Flexibility of users involved may lead to miscommunication.



Spiral: Using this methodology, each phase begins with a milestone in design/development and ends with the client reviewing the progress. After review more milestones are added in ever-increasing spirals until implementation is complete.
  Advantages
•	Progress can be monitored from the first stage.
•	Development is quite fast, additional features can be added at a later stage in a systematic pattern.
•	There is always a space for feedback after each stage.


  Disadvantages
•	Works best for very large projects, it may cost a lot in time and resources for small projects.
•	It involves more documentation as it has intermediate phases.
•	The systematic pattern must be followed strictly for it to succeed.

Each of these methodologies have been proven to be successful and effective for traditional software development projects. 
However the project, just like other website projects, is unique in nature and has its own special characteristics. 
This makes each of these traditional methodologies on its own unsuitable for website development. 
The best way forward is to try a modern methodology that applies to website development. 
Jeary et al. (2009) did a comprehensive research on these modern web development methodologies.
They reached the conclusion that modern web development methodologies have some issues. 
The steps are not usually well detailed. 
There is also no detailed analysis of what the user is going to do in each step; no guidelines guidelines to show what actions need to be taken in each step.

After much deliberation, it was decided that a systematic methodology would make the project organized from the start.
It would also allow the whole development process to be broken into steps, with detailed information on the key objectives and challenges on each step. 
The methodology will be generic and can be adjusted at any step to meet the requirements of the project topic.
Also the valuable advice of the supervising professor was key to using such a methodology.
