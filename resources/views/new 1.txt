The current work is the initial background report for the e-Business website development project. The current work is simple but effective implementation of an apartment rental website. The choice to go for a minimalisticc apprroach was because the target market is international students coming in to the United Kingdom to further their education. The website does a great job in offering the stakeholders with just enough features to conduct transactions seamlessly without necessary physical contact.
However there are still avenues for more work to be done. It will be an innovative move if students could video chat with hosts directly from the website, along with the current text messaging. Also, the website should be able to offer upsells like cab services, food delivery services nearby to students who rent apartments. This could be achieved by integrating with these vendors.
